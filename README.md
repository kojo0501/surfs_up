## Overview

### Purpose of Analysis
Apparently I love surfing now and want to do it forever? I'm seeking to open a surf & shake shop but require investor backing from W. Avy. Avy failed with a surf shop early in his career due to poor weather. I am analyzing the weather to find the best location for a surf shop. 

### Scope of Analysis
This specific analysis here evaluates temperature differences between June and December based on weather data from 2010 thru mid-2017.
