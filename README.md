## Overview

### Purpose of Analysis
I'm seeking to open a surf & shake shop but require investor backing from W. Avy. Avy failed with a surf shop early in his career due to poor weather. I am analyzing the weather to find the best location for a surf shop. 

### Scope of Analysis
This specific analysis here evaluates temperature differences between June and December based on weather data from 2010 thru mid-2017.

## Results

### Data Charts for June and December
Data from June: <br>

Data from December: <br>

### Key Differences for Analyzed Data
* The average temperature was warmer in June than December by about four degrees, with June's average temperature at 75 degrees and December's average temperature at 71 degrees. 
* The temperatures in December fluctuated far more than June's temperatures. This can be demonstrated by the higher standard deviation in December (3.75) compared with June's standard deviation (3.26). It can also be demonstrated by the low temperature for December, which was 8 degrees farenheit lower than June temperatures. December low temperature was a brisk 56 degrees compared to June's more moderate 64 degrees.
* The sample size for December was slightly smaller than June. June had seven full years of data to analyze while December had only six years of data. June had 1,700 data points while December had 1,517.

## Summary

### Conclusion Based on Analysis
Based on analyzing solely temperature, June seems to be a consistently warmer month, with less variation in the weather. The warmer weather, and fewer temperature fluctuations, make it consistently better for surfing and ice cream.

### Further Exploration
Precipitation requires further exploration, specifically because W. Avy's first surf shop was rained out of business.

An additional query could be to group the temperatures by weather station. Based on the location of the weather stations relative to the potential surf shop, it may make sense to exclude the data. This is specifically important when dealing with precipitation.
